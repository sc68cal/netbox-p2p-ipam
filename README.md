### NetBox setup

You can use the vanilla [netbox-docker][nbd] docker-compose file.

### Containerlab

While containerlab [does support being run in a container](https://containerlab.dev/install/#container), it's not 100%
cross-platform. It is better to run it via Vagrant since podman & windows still has some issues.
